==================

Does your rhetoric homework for you

Dependencies
============
None. Uses only the Python 3 standard libraries.

To run, clone the repo and run `python3 -i writer.py`. Initialization takes a few seconds but once you enter the interpreter, you have access to two functions:
`generate_sentence()` -- does what you think
`generate_essay(length)` -- writes you an essay that is `length` sentences long.
